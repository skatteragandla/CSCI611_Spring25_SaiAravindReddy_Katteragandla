# CSCI 611 - Assignment 2: Image Processing & CNN Implementation

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **image filtering** and **deep learning with CNN** as part of **CSCI 611 - Assignment 2**. 

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Image Processing**: Edge detection, blurring, scaling, and corner detection using OpenCV.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Training a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification using PyTorch.

## How to Run the Code

###  Running Image Processing Code (OpenCV)
1. Navigate to the **`image_filtering/`** directory.
2. Open `image_filtering.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run all the cells to apply various **image processing techniques**, including:
   - **Edge Detection**
   - **Blurring**
   - **Scaling**
   - **Corner Detection**

---

### Running CNN Training & Evaluation (PyTorch)
1. Navigate to the **`build_cnn/`** directory.
2. Open `build_cnn.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run all cells to:
   - **Load the CIFAR-10 dataset**
   - **Define the CNN architecture**
   - **Train the model**
   - **Evaluate model performance on test data**
   - **Visualize results**
